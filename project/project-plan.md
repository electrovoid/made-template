# Project Plan

## Title
<!-- Give your project a short title. -->
Amazon Rainforest Degradation

## Main Question

<!-- Think about one main question you want to answer based on the data. -->
How has the rise in temperature affected the forest biodiversity in Brazil?

## Description

<!-- Describe your data science project in max. 200 words. Consider writing about why and how you attempt it. -->
Climate change has been a problem that may seemingly not affect us, but is sure to have dire consequences in the future. In this project, I will be analysing the effects the deforestation of the Brazilian Amazon Rainforest, and how it might correlate with the rise in temperature in the country.

## Datasources

<!-- Describe each datasources you plan to use in a section. Use the prefic "DatasourceX" where X is the id of the datasource. -->
